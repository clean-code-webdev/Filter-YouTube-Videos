# Filter YouTube Videos

**Hide OLD YouTube videos** on your home page or filter them as you wish.

Filter YouTube Videos makes it easy for you to hide those ancient videos you don't care about but keeps appearing on your home page. Additionally, you can filter videos and display them by live, hours, days, weeks, months, or years, all of it with just a click.

Note: After the installation, please restart the YouTube page. Refreshing the YouTube Home page is required for the filter to be displayed.

Once "Filter YouTube Videos" has been installed, and the Home page has been refreshed, **you will see a new option appear right above the "Home" option on the left side of your screen**. Note that this option is currently available only on the Home page.

You will see a filter icon, the word "Filtered:" and a + icon.

### Note the new option above Home ###

## How to install:

 -  in Chrome, enter the address "chrome://extensions/".

## How it works:

-   Note: YouTube chooses the displayed videos. "Filter YouTube Videos" doesn't do anything to choose what videos will be displayed but simply hides videos that are not in the range set in the options.
    
-   in order to enable/disable the filter, simply click on the icon or the word "Filtered." If the option is grayed out, that means it's disabled, while if it is black, it is enabled.
    
-   to see the filter options, simply click the + icon. A range of options (live, hours, days, weeks, months. years) will be displayed. Ps. The default range is set to "years" in order to prevent possible wanted videos from not been displayed.
    
-   "live": live videos as well as coming lives
    
-   "hours": videos uploaded within the last 24 hours
    
-   "days": videos uploaded within the last week
    
-   "weeks": videos uploaded within the last month
    
-   "months": videos uploaded within the past year
    
-   "years": videos uploaded at any time
    
-   the number of filtered videos will be displayed in front of the "Filtered" word.
    
-   Once you have chosen the desired range in the filter, "Filter YouTube Videos" will be triggered every time a change happens in the area where the videos are displayed.
